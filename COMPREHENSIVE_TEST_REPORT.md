- **XOR Cipher:** 0% encode/decode/crack (see error logs)
- **Atbash Cipher:** 100% (encode/decode/crack)
- **Substitution Cipher:** 100% decode, 0% encode/crack (see error logs)

### Dictionary Attack with Full words_alpha.txt
- **Tested with 370,105 words**
- **Classic Vigenère test (RIJVSUYVJN, key=KEY, plaintext=HELLO):**
  - **Result:** Correct key and plaintext NOT found. Top results were unrelated keys and gibberish plaintexts (best confidence: 33.6%).
  - **Evidence:**
    - CLI output: "Loaded 370105 custom words from: words_alpha.txt"
    - "BEST MATCH: WARMOUTHS (Confidence: 37.4%)"
    - "Decoded: VISJEAFORR"
    - **Iteration cap reached:**
      - Log: `[cryptanalyze] Iteration cap reached in dictionary attack.`
      - **User prompt:** When the cap is reached, the user can enter 'y' to continue once, or 'ya' to continue without further prompts. This allows the attack to be as exhaustive as the user wants, with no risk of runaway computation.
      - Log: `Finished Vigenère analysis. Total iterations: 750210`
  - **Conclusion:** The dictionary attack is robust and user-friendly, but still not effective for short ciphertexts, even with the full dictionary. This is a real, evidence-backed limitation.

### CLI Help/Error Handling
- **Status:** Fully functional after installing dependencies in a virtual environment.
- **All help and error commands now work as expected.**

### Confidence Scoring Analysis

- Improve CLI argument parsing and help system
- Enhance dictionary attack algorithms for Vigenère/Substitution
