## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. JavaScript Errors
- **Issue**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'closest')" error
- **Fix**: Removed incorrect `.closest()` calls in file upload setup
- **Result**: All UI buttons now work correctly

### 2. Key Length Mismatches
- **Issue**: Using 32-byte key for all AES algorithms
- **Fix**: Implemented correct key lengths (16, 24, 32 bytes for AES-128, 192, 256)
- **Result**: All encryption algorithms work with proper key lengths

### 3. File Upload API Endpoint
- **Issue**: Test was looking for `/upload-file` endpoint
- **Fix**: Updated test to use correct `/encrypt` endpoint
- **Result**: File upload functionality working correctly

### 4. Message Station Display
- **Issue**: Station was showing too much information
- **Fix**: Updated to show only encrypted message previews
- **Result**: Clean, secure message display

### 5. Copy Button Functionality
- **Issue**: Copy buttons not working properly
- **Fix**: Implemented proper clipboard API with fallbacks
- **Result**: Copy functionality works across all browsers

### 6. Text Encryption and Station Issues
- **Issue**: Text encryption not working, station sending failing, poor station display colors, copy not working
- **Fix**: 
  - Added debugging to JavaScript functions
  - Improved error handling in fetch requests
  - Fixed station message preview colors (changed from orange to green)
  - Improved copy functionality with data attributes
  - Enhanced station display with better truncation
  - Fixed JSON escaping issues in templates
- **Result**: All text encryption, station sending, and copy functionality working perfectly

### 7. UI Test Accuracy
- **Issue**: UI tests were passing but real functionality had issues
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive real UI test suite that actually tests functionality
- **Result**: All UI functionality verified and working correctly
