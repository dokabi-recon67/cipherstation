### Message Relay Station: Secure Encrypted Dead Drop

CipherStation's Message Relay Station features a comprehensive 6-step workflow for secure message relay. Users encode messages with classical ciphers, encrypt with modern algorithms, and upload to the station for ticket-based retrieval. The system includes a rotating public message board showing available messages (without content leaks), automatic 24-hour message deletion, and high message capacity. Recipients can browse the public board or enter specific ticket numbers to retrieve encrypted messages. Only those with the ticket number and decryption details can access the content. The system is designed for privacy, education, and security—ideal for learning cryptography concepts while maintaining practical security standards.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cryptography'
```
**Solution**: Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
Address already in use
```
**Solution**: Kill the process using the port or use a different port

#### Key File Issues
```bash
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```
**Solution**: Ensure key files exist and have correct permissions

#### Classical Ciphers Not Available
```bash
Warning: Classical ciphers module not found
```
**Solution**: Ensure `classical_ciphers.py` is in the same directory

### Performance Tips

## Secure Dead Drop

CipherStation features a secure dead drop system for encrypted message exchange. This system allows users to upload encrypted messages to a public message board, where they are visible only as ciphertext. Each message is associated with a unique ticket number. Only users with the correct ticket and decryption credentials can retrieve and decrypt the message. Messages are automatically deleted after 24 hours, ensuring privacy and minimizing data retention. The dead drop is implemented using a persistent SQLite database, providing durability and resilience across server restarts. This approach enables real-world secure communication and is suitable for privacy-focused, time-limited message exchange scenarios.

**Key properties:**
- Public message board displays only encrypted content (no plaintext exposure)
- Ticket-based retrieval: only those with the ticket and decryption details can access the message
- Automatic 24-hour message expiration and cleanup
- High message capacity and efficient retrieval
- No user registration or persistent identity required
